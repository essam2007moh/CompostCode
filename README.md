# CompostCode
Smart Composter with Arduino C++

  Our project name is ECO STRAW; our main Idea came out from the problem chosen at the 
first place. The main problem is that rice straw is always getting disposed in the wrong way 
whether: burning it, disposing it into the sewage and canals, or just throwing it into the rivers. 
The rice straw undergoes three processes the first give us the primary product (ethanol), the 
second gives us fertilizer, then fermenting the wasted material remains with black molasses, 
finally the remaining ash of all the processes gets mixed with white cement to give bricks. Also,
we use the rice straw to make packaging materials.
